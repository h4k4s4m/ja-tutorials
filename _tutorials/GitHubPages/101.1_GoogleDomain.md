Github pages is a great way to host your website for free and easily keep it updated using your master branch.

  - Go to your Repository. 
  - Click on Settings
  - Under GitHub Pages, change the source to `Master`

2. Scroll down to Custom Domain and add your Domain from Google. Then press save. 
    {% include image.html image="GitHubPages/setDomain.gif" class="img-large" %}
3. Add CNAME to your Google Domain
  - Go to your Google Domains Portal and select 'Configure DNS' of the Domain you wish to attach to your GitHub Pages.
  - Scroll down to 'Custom Resource Records'
  - Set name to `www`
  - Set type to `CNAME`
  - Set domain name to `username.github.io`.
